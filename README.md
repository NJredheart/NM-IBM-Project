## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

use python server

📚 How It Works

The user enters a task in the input field and clicks Add Task.
The new task appears in the task list with options to Edit, Delete, or Mark as Complete.

Each task is stored in the browser’s localStorage, so it remains even after page reloads.

When the user edits or deletes a task, the change is immediately reflected in the UI and localStorage

🧠 Challenges and Solutions (Brief Summary)

Challenge: Tasks disappeared after refreshing the page.
Solution: Implemented localStorage for data persistence.

Challenge: Layout broke on smaller screens. Solution: Used CSS Flexbox and Media Queries for responsiveness.

Challenge: Merge conflicts in GitHub. Solution: Used branching strategy and frequent commits.
